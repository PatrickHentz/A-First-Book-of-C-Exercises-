2. (Practice) Compile and run Program 2.1.
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout << "\nData Type  Bytes";
	cout << "\n-------- - ---- - ";
	cout << "\nint          " << sizeof(int);
	cout << "\nchar         " << sizeof(char);
	cout << "\nbool         " << sizeof(bool);

cout << '\n';
	system("PAUSE");
	return 0;
}
3. (Modify) Modify Program 2.1 to determine the storage your compiler uses for all the C++
integer data types.
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout << "\nData Type  Bytes";
	cout << "\n-------- - ---- - ";
	cout << "\nint          " << sizeof(int);

	cout << "\nbool         " << sizeof(bool);
	cout << "\nshort int                 " << sizeof(short int);
	cout << "\nlong int                  " << sizeof(long int);

   P        A        T        R        I         C        K
6. (Modify) Modify Program 2.1 to determine how many bytes your compiler assigns to the
float, double, and long double data types.
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout << "\nData Type  Bytes";
	cout << "\n-------- - ---- - ";
	cout << "\nfloat          " << sizeof(float);  //4
	cout << "\ndouble         " << sizeof(double); //8
	cout << "\nlong double    " << sizeof(long double); //8

	cout << '\n';
	system("PAUSE");
 	return 0;
}

c. 8.395e1
83.95
d. 2.95e-3

8. (Practice) Convert the following numbers from scientific notation to standard decimal form:

g. .006789

10. (For thought) Because computers use different representations for storing integer, floatingpoint,
double-precision, and character values, discuss how a program might alert the computer
to the data types of different values it will be using.

A program's complier may alert the developer to a data type differents by the the current data type for compatablity.
The resulting conflict would than flagged as an error and a suggested data type by the complier could be tested.
11. (For thought) Although you have concentrated on operations involving integer and floatingpoint
numbers, C++ allows adding and subtracting characters and integers. (These operations
are possible with characters because they’re integer data types and are stored by using integer
codes.) Therefore, characters and integers can be mixed in arithmetic expressions. For example,
if your computer uses the ASCII code, the expression 'a' + 1 equals 'b' and 'z' - 1
equals 'y'. Similarly, 'A'+ 1 is 'B' and 'Z'- 1 is 'Y'. With this information as background,
determine the character results of the following expressions. (Assume all characters
are stored by using ASCII codes.)
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
a. 'm'- 5 = 'h'
b. 'm'+ 5 = 'r'
c. 'G'+ 6 = 'M'
d. 'G'- 6 = 'A'
e. 'b'+ 7 = 'i'
f. 'g'- 1 = 'f'
g. 'G'- 1 ='F'
12. (Practice) Although the total number of bytes varies from computer to computer, memory
sizes of 65,536 to more than several million bytes are common. In computer language, the
letter K represents the number 1024, which is 2 raised to the 10th power, and M represents the
number 1,048,576, which is 2 raised to the 20th power. Therefore, a memory size of 640 KB is
really 640 times 1024 (655,360 bytes), and a memory size of 4 MB is really 4 times 1,048,576
(4,194,304 bytes). Using this information, calculate the actual number of bytes in the following:
a. A memory containing 512 MB
512 x 1,048,576 = 536,870,912 bytes
b. A memory consisting of 256 MB words, with each word consisting of 2 bytes
(256 x 1,048,576) x 2 = 536,870,912 bytes
c. A memory consisting of 256 MB words, with each word consisting of 4 bytes
(256 x 1,048,576) x 4 = 1,073,741,824 bytes 
d. A thumb drive that specifies 2 MB
2 x 1,048,576 = 2,097,152 bytes
e. A disk that specifies 250 MB
250 x 1,048,576 = 262,144,000 bytes
f. A disk that specifies 8 GB (Hint: See Table 2.6.)
8 x 1,073,741,824 = 8,589,934,592 bytes
