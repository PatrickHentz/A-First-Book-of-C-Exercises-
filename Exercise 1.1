Exchange money for the loaf of bread

d. Roast a turkey.
Buy a turkey
Take turkey out of bag
Season and Stuff turkey
Place Turkey on Tray
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Place turkey in oven
Roast for 45 minutes
Remove turkey after roasting

3. (Practice) Determine and write an algorithm (list the steps) to interchange the contents of
two cups of liquid. Assume that a third cup is available to hold the contents of either cup temporarily.
Each cup should be rinsed before any new liquid is poured into it.

Label cups #1, #2, and #3, with #3 being the empty cup
Rinse #3
Pour contents of #1 into #3
Rinse #1
Pour contents of #2 into #1
Rinse #2
Pour contents of #3 into #2
Rinse #3


4. (Practice) Write a detailed set of instructions in English to calculate the dollar amount of
money in a piggybank that contains h half-dollars, q quarters, n nickels, d dimes, and p pennies.

For every h assign the value of .50
For ever q assign the value of .25
For every n assign the value of .5
For every d assign the value of .10
For every p assign the value of .01
Sort the piggybank's contents by h, q, n, d, p.
Multiply each coin type by it's repected multiple (i).
Utilize a function such as this (h * i)+(q * i)+(n * i)+(d * i)+(p * i).
Calculate the values so that they are equal to the total value in the piggybank.

5. (Practice) Write a set of detailed, step-by-step instructions in English to find the smallest
number in a group of three integer numbers.

For each value check for the lowest integer
Assign the current value to the lowest integer
if the lowest value is equal to the current value after looking at every interger
than the current integer is the lowest.
Print the current value as the lowest integer.

6. (Practice) a. Write detailed, step-by-step instructions in English to calculate the fewest number
of dollar bills needed to pay a bill of amount TOTAL. For example, if TOTAL were $98,
the bills would consist of one $50 bill, two $20 bills, one $5 bill, and three $1 bills. For this
exercise, assume that only $100, $50, $20, $10, $5, and $1 bills are available.

For each value in the collection of values 
Subtract the largest value from TOTAL that can be calucated without resulting in a negative value.
So 98-50 = 48 and the result is now equal to the current value.
48-20 = 18 and now 18 is equal to the current value.
18-10 = 8 etc...
8-5 = 3
3-1-1-1 = 0
Calucate the Total Number of bills equal to the number increments til zero is reached.
Once the total equal zero the number of bills used should be seven.

b. Repeat Exercise 6a, but assume the bill is to be paid only in $1 bills.

If you only used one dollar bills than the Total value is equal the the total number of bills.

7. (Practice) a. Write an algorithm to locate the first occurrence of the name JEAN in a list of
names arranged in random order.

//Boyer–Moore string search algorithm is the best algorithm to use in the case.
void search( char *txt,  char *pat)
{
    int m = strlen(pat);
    int n = strlen(txt);
 
    int badchar[NO_OF_CHARS];
    badCharHeuristic(pat, m, badchar);
 
    int s = 0;  
    while(s <= (n - m))
    {
        int j = m-1;

        while(j >= 0 && pat[j] == txt[s+j])
            j--;
        if (j < 0)
        {
            printf("\n pattern occurs at shift = %d", s);
 
            s += (s+m < n)? m-badchar[txt[s+m]] : 1;
        }
        else
            s += max(1, j - badchar[txt[s+j]]);
    }
}
b. Discuss how you could improve your algorithm for Exercise 7a if the list of names were
arranged in alphabetical order.

If the text was in alphabetical order than the algorithm can be run faster
by jumping the the first letter of the word JEAN. 

8. (Practice) Determine and write an algorithm to sort three numbers in ascending (from lowest
to highest) order. How would you solve this problem heuristically?



9. (Practice) Define an appropriate class for each of the following specific objects:
a. The number 5
b. A square measuring 4 inches by 4 inches
c. This C++ book
d. A 1955 Ford Thunderbird car
e. The last ballpoint pen you used

10. (Practice) a. What operations should the following objects be capable of doing?
i. A 1955 Ford Thunderbird car

ii. The last ballpoint pen you used

b. Do the operations determined for Exercise 10a apply only to the particular object listed, or
are they more general and applicable to all objects of the type listed?
